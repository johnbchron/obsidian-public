## What is Intercession?
- Intercession is prayer, it's speaking His Word back to Him, and it's standing in the gap.
- Priests, mediators, watchmen, and intercessors all share the same role.

## We are called as Intercessors.
- We are all priests, so we are called to minister to the lord and to be speaking to Him ([1 Peter 2:5](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/1PE.2.5)).
- His house is a place of prayer for all nations, and because of that it's a place of joy ([Isaiah 56:7](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/ISA.56.7)).
- The Lord calls us to 24 hour intercession in [Isaiah 62:1-7](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/ISA.62.1-7):
	- He delights in us, and that's the source of our perseverance.
	- He calls the watchmen on the walls to never be silent, day or night.
	- "All you who call on the Lord, give yourself no rest, and give Him no rest until He establishes Jerusalem, and makes her the praise of the Earth."

## Old Testament Intercessors.
- Elijah
	- He shows up unannounced and declares that the Lord will shut up the heavens. ([1 Kings 17:1](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/1KI.17.1)). He was bold because he had won the battle in the spirit first.
	- Elijah's prayers over the course of his life affected nations. Because he prayed in agreement with the will of the Lord, the Lord acted powerfully through his prayers.
	- When facing the prophets of Baal, Elijah prayed "Lord, please reveal who You are and who I am to You. Show the people that You hear my prayers." ([1 Kings 18:36-37](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/1KI.18.36-37))
	- Elijah felt in his spirit that the Lord was deciding to end the drought (he said "there is the sound of a heavy rain" - [1 Kings 18:41](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/1KI.18.41)), but he still prayed. The Lord spoke to him, and he spoke the Word of the Lord back to Him. Praying for things that the Lord has already said he will do is like signing the check that the Lord gives you; He waits for us to accept His gifts.
	- Elijah persevered in praying for the rain, because he knew in his spirit that the Lord wanted to end the drought.
- Daniel
	- Daniel learned from the writings of Jeremiah that the Lord was going to bring Israel back from Babylon after 70 years ([Daniel 9:1-2](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/DAN.9.1-2)), but he still prayed that the Lord would do it. His response was to seek the Lord.
		- Again, praying for things the Lord has already said He would do is like signing the check that the Lord has given you.
		- Prophetic words from the Lord are invitations to partner with Him. He is inviting us to ask Him about what He said He would do.
		- "Timothy, my son, here are my instructions for you, based on the prophetic words spoken about you earlier. May they help you fight well in the Lordâ€™s battles." ([1 Timothy 1:18](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/1TI.1.18)). Prophetic words give us the confidence that the things we're asking for are the will of the Lord.
	- Daniel is visited by a messenger from Heaven. He says that from the first day Daniel prayed, his request was heard in Heaven. He was delayed for 21 days by the prince of Persia, but now he has come in response to Daniel's prayer. Daniel's persistence allowed him to see breakthrough ([Daniel 10](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/DAN.10)).
	- Daniel's power in the spirit was built on decades of faithfully praying 3 times a day.
	- When Daniel understood the prophetic season, he pressed into prayer even more.
	- Daniel received prophetic insight in the context of intercession. It was released through prayer.
- Abraham
	- Abraham was God's friend. When the Lord was planning to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, the Lord himself came to speak with Abraham about it.
	- The Lord decided to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because the outcry from them was great ([Genesis 18:20](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/GEN.18.20)). It also says Lot was a righteous man whose soul was tormented by the wickedness around him ([2 Peter 2:8](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/2PE.2.8)). The outcry of Lot's soul was among that which the Lord heard and came in response to.
	- Abraham reasoned with the Lord and moved His heart, so he said "Then I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten \[righteous people\]". Even though the angels didn't find 10 righteous people, Lot was still saved in response to Abraham's request ([Genesis 19:29](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/GEN.19.29)).
	- The Lord invites humans into His council when cities and nations are on the brink of judgement because He longs to be merciful, and He gives us the opportunity to ask for mercy on behalf of those about to be judged.
- Job
	- Job longed for an intercessor, but there was none ([Job 9:32-35](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JOB.9.32-35)).
	- Jesus is the mediator that Job longed for ([1 Timothy 2:5](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/1TI.2.5)).

## The Word of God.
- The Word of God has such power ([Hebrews 4:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/HEB.4.12)).
	- God created the world by *speaking* ([Genesis 1:1-3](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/GEN.1.1-3), [John 1:1-3](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JHN.1.1-3)).
	- Jesus is the Word of God, and the way He speaks ([Hebrews 1:1-2](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/HEB.1.1-2)).
	- Jesus, the Word, is interceding for us eternally ([Hebrews 7:24-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/HEB.7.24-25)).
	- Speaking the Word of God according to His will releases power ([John 8:28](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JHN.8.28)).
	- Just as the centurion's spoken word carries the power and weight of Rome, the spoken Word of God carries the power and weight of heaven ([Matthew 8:8-9](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/MAT.8.8-9)).
- Intercession is like breathing; you breathe in His Word, and then speak it back to Him.
- To know His will and to speak His Word back to Him, we must study and know His Word ([Jeremiah 31:33](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JER.31.33), [Psalm 119:11](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/PSA.119.11))
- Jesus is the temple ([John 2:19-22](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JHN.2.19-22)), the place where Heaven and Earth come together perfectly.
- Jesus is the perfect mediator between God and mankind ([1 Timothy 2:5](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/1TI.2.5)), and he is the fulfillment of the role Moses had between God and the Israelites ([Galatians 3:19-20](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/GAL.3.19-20)).

## The Will of God.
- "Now this is the confidence we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, he hears us." ([1 John 5:14](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/1JN.5.14))
	- Our confidence in intercession comes from knowing His will, so we need to know His will.
	- To know His will, we need to receive. "What do *you* want, Lord?"
- The core of what He wants is to be close to us.
	- "God has now revealed to us his mysterious will regarding Christ -- which is to fulfill his own good plan. And this is the plan: At the right time he will bring everything together under the authority of Christ -- everything in heaven and on earth." ([Ephesians 1:9-10](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/EPH.1.9-10))
- The Lord has been building bridges to us and providing ways for us and Him to live together throughout all of our story.
	- The first thing God did after He created Adam was to plant a garden ([Genesis 2:8](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/GEN.2.8)). He "walked in the garden in the cool of the day" ([Genesis 3:8](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/GEN.3.8)). The garden was His dwelling place, His first temple on Earth.
	- God told Moses: "Have the people of Israel build me a holy sanctuary so I can live among them." ([Exodus 25:8](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/EXO.25.8)). He set aside an entire tribe of Israel devoted to ministering to Him and acting as His intermediaries (intercessors).
	- David vowed that he would not rest until he found a place for the house of the Lord ([Psalm 132:2-5](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/PSA.132.2-5)). The first thing he tried to do after conquering Jerusalem was to bring the Ark of the Covenant there ([2 Samuel 6:2](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/2SA.6.2)), and then he wanted to build a house for the Lord. David had a heart of intercession -- the painful longing for union between Heaven and Earth.
	- All throughout the Old Testament, the Lord is having the people rebuild the temple and re-establish worship ([Haggai 1:7-9](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/HAG.1.7-9)). He keeps pointing to the future where He will really live among us ([Ezekiel 43:7](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/EZK.43.7), [Zechariah 2:10](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/ZEC.2.10)).
	- Then Jesus came. Jesus is the temple ([John 2:19, 22](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JHN.2.19,22)). He is the only one who can stand in the gap, the true and perfect intercessor. Heaven and earth *have* and *will* come together through Him ([Ephesians 1:10](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/EPH.1.10)).
	- We are now each a temple, and the Holy Spirit lives within us ([1 Corinthians 6:19](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/1CO.6.19)).
	- In Revelation, we look forward to when the union between God and mankind will be fully and perfectly established for eternity ([Revelation 21:1-5](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/REV.21.1-5), [Revelation 22:1-5](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/REV.22.1-5)). Everything will be made right. This is our complete fulfillment.
- The union of Heaven and Earth, God and mankind, is also what we hunger for most ([Romans 8:18-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/ROM.8.18-25).

## What keeps us from being Intercessors?
- **Pride**: we don't come to the Lord if we don't acknowledge our need. We need Him ([John 15:5](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JHN.15.5)).
	- God opposes the proud ([James 4:6](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JAS.4.6)). We cannot intercede if God opposes us.
- **Unbelief**: without faith it is impossible to please Him ([Hebrews 11:6](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/HEB.11.6)).
	- We cannot speak His Word back to Him if we don't believe it.
- **We don't know our calling as priests**: we share in the Heavenly calling ([Hebrews 3:1](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/HEB.3.1)), and all the believers together are a kingdom of priests ([Revelation 5:9-10](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/REV.5.9-10)).
	- If we don't know our calling as priests, we won't engage with Him or partner with Him.
- **We don't think prayer is effective**: our unrenewed minds think that the flesh is more effective than the spirit, but "the **prayers** of a righteous man are powerful and effective" ([James 5:16](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JAS.5.16)), not his flesh.
	- This is similar to unbelief.
